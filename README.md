# Sales Performance Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is designed to load sales data from CSV or JSON files into a SQLite database and perform analysis using LangChain agents. The analysis provides detailed feedback on sales performance metrics, strengths, areas for improvement, and overall evaluation.

## Features

- Load data from CSV or JSON files into a SQLite database.
- Analyze sales data using LangChain agents.
- Provide detailed feedback on sales performance.
- View intermediate steps and logs for detailed insights.
- Developed using Django, Python, and LangChain.

## Setup

### Step 1: Define the Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

```env
DATA_FILE_PATH=sales_performance_data.csv
DATABASE_URL=salesdata.db
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have `Poetry` installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

### Step 3: Load Data

To load data into the SQLite database, run the following command:

```sh
poetry run python manage.py import_data
```

The data file specified in the `.env` file (either CSV or JSON) will be loaded into the SQLite database.

### Step 4: Run the Django Server

Start the Django development server:

```sh
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```
